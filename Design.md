## James Winestock Portfolio Design Guide
I have opted to make my my Portfolio site a simple, one page site in order to reduce clutter and increase the ease of finding useful information about me.
My hero image is of a painting by Thomas Cole called The Savage State and is drawn from a series of 5 paintings called the *Course of Empire*. I used it as I feel it invokes a natural image that has the potential for creative growth. The dense forest mixed with the images of primitive human civilization is representative of nascent creative projects waiting for growth.
